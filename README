COMPATIBLITY:
This project is developed in C and requires a POSIX-compliant environment (e.g., Linux or macOS)

EXECUTION: 
enter the following 2 lines in a terminal:
    gcc prodcon.c Checksum.c -o prodcon
    ./prodcon <delay> <producer_threads> <consumer_threads>

 where:
  <delay> = number of seconds to run the simulation
  <producer_threads> = number of producer threads to create
  <consumer_threads> = number of consumer threads to create

SAMPLE INPUT:
./prodcon 4 2 2
